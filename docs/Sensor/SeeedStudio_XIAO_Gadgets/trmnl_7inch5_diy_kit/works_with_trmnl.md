### Firmware Flashing
:::tip
If you got a brand new kit, it will have firmware inside. So you can skip this step.
:::

To get your TRMNL 7.5inch(OG) DIY kit working with TRMNL, you need to flash the appropriate firmware onto your device. There are three recommended methods:

#### Method 1: Flash via TRMNL Web Flasher (Easiest)

1. **Go to the TRMNL Web Flasher**

   - Visit [https://usetrmnl.com/flash](https://usetrmnl.com/flash)
   - This tool allows you to flash your device directly from your browser.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the flashing process.

## Configure Wi-Fi and Send Playlists to TRMNL

To use your TRMNL 7.5inch(OG) DIY kit with TRMNL and send playlists, you first need to connect the device to your Wi-Fi network. This process is called "WiFi pairing mode" and is done through a simple captive portal. Please follow the steps below:

> üí° **Troubleshooting Wi-Fi?** If you encounter issues connecting your device to Wi-Fi, please refer to the [TRMNL Device Wi-Fi Troubleshooting Guide](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/10193157-device-wifi-troubleshooting) for solutions to common networking and router compatibility issues.

### Power On and Enter Provisioning Mode

- After flashing the TRMNL firmware and powering on your device, it will automatically enter provisioning mode if it is not yet connected to Wi-Fi.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/216.jpg" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Connect to the TRMNL Wi-Fi

- On your **phone** or **computer**, open the list of available Wi-Fi networks.
- Look for a network named **TRMNL** and connect to it. (No password is required by default.)

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/217.png" style={{width:400, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Open the Captive Portal

- Once connected, open a web browser (such as Chrome or Edge).
- The device should automatically redirect you to the TRMNL configuration page. If it does not, manually visit [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1) in your browser.

### Enter Your Wi-Fi Credentials

- On the configuration page, you will see a list of available Wi-Fi networks.
- **Select your 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network** (TRMNL does not support 5GHz networks).
- Enter your Wi-Fi password.
- Click **Save** or **Connect**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Make sure to use a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. 5GHz networks are not supported by the ESP32-C3 chip.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/218.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### Device Connects to Your Network

- The device will attempt to connect to your Wi-Fi.
- Once successful, it will disconnect from the TRMNL Wi-Fi and join your home network.
- The window will show the device's MAC address. **Please record the MAC address**, as you will need it in a later step.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/219.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The MAC address is only visible in the captive portal for 1-2 seconds. If you miss it, you can also:
> - Retrieve it from the VS Code > PlatformIO build/upload logs.
> - Use the [usetrmnl.com/flash](https://usetrmnl.com/flash) method and check the Chrome/Edge/Firefox developer console for the MAC address during flashing.
> - Find it in your router or Mesh network app's list of connected devices.
>
> For more details and screenshots, see the official guide: [Finding your TRMNL MAC address](https://help.usetrmnl.com/en/articles/10614205-finding-your-trmnl-mac-address)

### Access the TRMNL Web Interface

After your TRMNL 7.5inch(OG) DIY kit is connected to your Wi-Fi and you have recorded its MAC address (Device ID), you can add it to your TRMNL account:

1. **Open the TRMNL Web Interface**  
   - On your computer or mobile device, open a browser and go to the [TRMNL web interface](https://trmnl.app).

2. **Go to the Devices Page**  
   - In the TRMNL interface, navigate to the **Devices** section.

3. **Add a New Device**  
   - Click the **Add new device** button, which is usually found at the top right corner or in the center of the Devices page.

   <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/220.png" style={{width:800, height:'auto'}}/></div>

4. **Enter Device ID**  
   - In the pop-up window, enter the Device ID you received when you purchased TRMNL access (this is not the MAC address). Use the Device ID from your purchase confirmation email or TRMNL dashboard.
   - Click **Add new device** to complete the process.

   <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/212.png" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

5. **Register XIAO 7.5" Device MAC Address**

   In order to build a connection between the XIAO epaper panel and TRMNL, we need to bind the correct device MAC address inside the TRMNL settings page.

   <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/223.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

   - You can retrieve the MAC address during the PlatformIO upload process (check the upload logs), or from the provisioning portal (it will be displayed after Wi-Fi setup).
   - Adding your MAC address early helps ensure a smooth onboarding process and device management.

   - Then you can set a custom name for your ePaper Panel and adjust other settings as needed.

   <div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/213.png" style={{width:700, height:'auto'}}/></div>

Your TRMNL 7.5inch(OG) DIY kit is now linked to your TRMNL account! You can now send playlists, images, or other content to your display directly from the TRMNL interface.

> üí° **Tip:** If you have multiple ePaper Panels, repeat the above steps for each device using their unique Device IDs.

:::caution
After adding your device in the TRMNL web interface, please go to the device's settings page and **turn off** both **Firmware Early Release** and **OTA Updates Enabled**.  

If these options are left enabled, your device may automatically download and install firmware updates from TRMNL when connected to the internet. These updates are intended for official TRMNL hardware and **are not compatible with the TRMNL 7.5inch(OG) DIY kit**. Installing incompatible firmware may cause your device to malfunction or become unresponsive.

Always keep both options disabled to ensure stable operation of your XIAO ePaper Panel.

## Understanding the TRMNL Playlist Feature

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/221.png" style={{width:1000, height:'auto'}}/></div>

The TRMNL Playlist feature allows you to control exactly what is displayed on your ePaper Panel and when. Here's a breakdown of the main sections and controls, as shown in the screenshot above:

### Playlist Overview
- **Playlist Title**: At the top, you see the name of your TRMNL device (e.g., "MengDu's TRMNL").
- **Display Time Range**: You can set the time range for when the playlist is active (e.g., from 00:00 to 23:45).
- **Update Interval**: Choose how often the display updates (e.g., every 5 minutes).
- **Add a Group / Add a Plugin**: Use these buttons to organize your playlist into groups or add new content plugins (such as weather, calendar, or custom text).

### Playlist Items
Each row in the playlist represents a screen or widget that will be shown on your ePaper Panel (for reference only):

1. **Weather**
   - Shows current weather information for your selected location.
   - The green "Displayed now" label indicates this screen is currently being shown on your device.
2. **Days Left This Year**
   - Displays a countdown of days remaining in the current year (e.g., "2025").
   - The label (e.g., "9 days ago") shows when this screen was last updated or displayed.
3. **Custom Text**
   - Lets you display any custom message (e.g., "Hello World").
   - Also shows when it was last updated.

For each item, you have several controls:
- **Settings (gear icon)**: Configure the plugin's options.
- **Delete (X icon)**: Remove the item from your playlist.
- **Preview (eye icon)**: Preview what the screen will look like.
- **Reorder (bars icon)**: Drag to change the order in which screens are displayed.

### Smart Playlist
- **Smart Playlist Option**: At the bottom, you can choose whether to automatically skip screens whose content hasn't changed (e.g., "Never skip screens").

This flexible playlist system lets you fully customize what your ePaper Panel displays, how often it updates, and in what order. You can mix and match different plugins to create a personalized dashboard that fits your needs.


## Exploring TRMNL Plugins

TRMNL's plugin system is what makes your ePaper Panel truly powerful and customizable. Plugins are modular apps or widgets that you can add to your device to display a wide variety of information and content.

<div style={{textAlign:'center'}}><img src="https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/xiao_075inch_epaper_panel/222.png" style={{width:900, height:'auto'}}/></div>

### What are Plugins?
Plugins are individual content blocks that can show things like weather, calendar events, stock prices, RSS feeds, motivational quotes, GitHub activity, and much more. You can mix and match plugins to create a dashboard that fits your needs.

### Connected Plugins
At the top of the Plugins page, you'll see all the plugins you've already connected to your TRMNL account. These are ready to be added to your playlist and displayed on your ePaper Panel. Examples include:
- **Weather**: Show current weather conditions.
- **Days Left This Year**: Countdown to the end of the year.
- **Stock Price**: Track your favorite stocks.
- **RSS Feed**: Display news or blog updates.
- **Reddit, Hacker News**: Show trending posts.
- **Language Learning, Motivational Quote, Custom Text**: Personalize your display with learning tools or custom messages.

### Plugin Marketplace
Below your connected plugins, you'll find the plugin marketplace. Here you can browse, search, and discover new plugins to add to your device. Plugins are organized by categories and tags (such as #productivity, #news, #ecommerce, etc.), making it easy to find what you need.

- **Browse & Search**: Use the search bar or tags to quickly find plugins that interest you.
- **Add Plugins**: Click on any plugin to connect it to your account and start using it in your playlist.

Developers can even create and publish their own plugins for others to use, making the ecosystem continually expand with new possibilities ([learn more about plugin creation](https://docs.usetrmnl.com/go/plugin-marketplace/introduction)).
